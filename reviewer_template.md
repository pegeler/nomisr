### Review Comments

#### Build/Install

Builds without NOTEs, WARNINGs, or ERRORs with R 3.4.1 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

#### Basic Package Structure Overview

##### README.md

The README.md file appears to contain all of the required information in the
packaging guide except for a link to a CODE\_OF\_CONDUCT.md or CONDUCT.md.

The README.md is also missing citation information, though I am not sure how
necessary that is since there is a CITATION file in the inst/ directory.

##### Description

The DESCRIPTION file does not currently specify a minimum version of R. I would
recommend doing so. A minor release is preferred over a patch release, e.g.

    Depends: R (>= 3.4.0)

is better than

    Depends: R (>= 3.4.1)

##### Citation

The CITATION file uses `meta$Date` to dynamically fill in date for the citation.
However, the `Date` entry is missing in the DESCRIPTION file so the date is NULL.

The CITATION file should also end in a newline character :)

##### Documentation

The man page for the package is named *nmisr*, not *nomisr*. This appears to be a typo.
